title: Grow your small business sales behaving like a millennial.
---

Remember those times when hiring an expensive website design agency was all you needed to advertise your business online? Well, times have dramatically changed. Nowadays, even if you don't have a formal online strategy, your customers, **specially millennials** are Tweeting about your business, posting to Facebook, uploading Instagram photos, writing Foursquare Tips and if you are in the food business they are surely publishing Yelp reviews. If your small business is not taking advantage of all of this, here are some tips you could leverage to reach new generations and improve your business.

1. **Gain New Customers.** In todays market consumers search first for the services or products they need. If you haven't modernized your web presence to reach any device you are missing out, and if you don’t have a social strategy linked to it, you are totally missing what the crowd is saying and feeling about your business.  

2. **Save Money.** Digital marketing campaigns can fit any budget, and is a great way to attract new prospects and even new markets, and in the end converting them into customers. Also the cost of maintaining a modern website is VERY affordable now and is a good way to promote your business.

3. **Target new and wider markets.** A modern website presence can be reached from anywhere anytime and any device, allowing for a wider range of potential audiences specially if you combine it with social media tools like Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.  

4. **Keep your customers up-to-date.** You can update information about your products or services in real time in any of your web and social channels, making it an effective way of keeping in touch and maintaining your customers informed.  

5. **Makes it easier for clients to recommend you.** Without a social presence, it becomes more difficult for your clients to link others with your products or services.

6. **Showcase your work.** A web and social presence is a good place to showcase your products or services in detail, and being active in your social channels can even expand your business to unforeseen markets.

7. **It improves Customer Service.** Adding engaging content, blogs and newsletters in your web channels also keep your customers up-to-date. Even your customer satisfaction can increase with real-time interaction in social channels like Twitter.

8. **Get instant feedback.** If you are active in your social networks and website blog, you can know how your customers think about a specific product or your brand. You could use this knowledge to your advantage amplifying the positive comments by engaging proactively, or diminishing the negative effects by providing solutions to negative feedback.  

Taking advantage of a social media presence can feel overwhelming, but behaving like a millennial could help incorporate these points into your small business strategy, so you can increase awareness, generate engagement, keep customers coming back and attract new business.
