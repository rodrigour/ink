title: Machine Learning Initial Ideas For Executives.

### A brief history of Machine Learning
Machine learning is founded on algorithms that could learn from information and data without relying on rules-based programming. The advances in digitization and growth in computer power in the late 90s, enable scientists train computers to learn instead of creating traditional models. In the last decade, the unmanageable volume and the complexity of data, have continued to increase the potential in Machine Learning and Data Science.

One great example comes from Stanford’s AI lab, when in 2007 they started leveraging this compute power, feeding models with millions of raw images. By using thousands of labeled images of an object, let’s say a chair, the machine model could decide if a specific combination of pixels was a match for a chair.

### Machine Learning-fed business models are bursting.
The discipline has evolved in the last decade, to the point of detecting strategic patterns from historical data, that could evolve and shape a business strategy.

**Top financial and insurance institutions** have incorporated machine learning techniques into their core business processes. For example, some financial institutions have constructed models to forecast which customers would avoid loan payments or cancel prematurely their service; and based on this create a new customer model to reduce their cost on cash collections, loan declines, and marketing targeting.

**In the oil and gas industry**, companies like Shell have gone to the task of using Machine Learning to analyze countless sources of historical data, from their geological, exploration, and mining processes to answer the most important question in the energy industry: Where is more oil?

**In horizontal areas like Talent Management**, companies like McKenzie consulting, made an experiment feeding a pool of thousands of historical resumes that the company receive to a Machine learning algorithm, select the top candidates, and at the end correlate them with their final hires over the years. Interestingly the predictions where highly correlated with their real results.

Examples like this have burst in the last couple of years, and as the more analog process get digitized, our capability to learn from data and leveraging Machine Learning algorithms will become a CORE component for any business to evolve and survive in this new era.

### What do I need to get started?
**Strategy.** Business executives will best take advantage of Machine Learning if they perceive it as “strategic” business tool to craft and implement their business vision. Without being considered strategic, machine learning as any other technology-based tools, have the risks of becoming just another operational tool; used to create siloed solutions in the organization.

**Business Data Scientist**. The executives in charge with building the strategic vision may have a data scientist with business experience, and as the overall strategy is formulated, guidance from C-level peers need to be part of the vision.

**Execution Roadmap**. Once the strategy is defined, the company must start with small wins, looking for low hanging fruits. This will reinforce how the organization can apply Machine Learning effectively.


### Involve the Top Management level
Machine Learning can bring significant cultural changes in an organization, from replacing existing traditional processes, arming front line positions (sales) with predictive tools to make more powerful decisions, reducing gaps in marketing new products, and in some cases re-inventing roles that might otherwise overlap with Machine Learning applications.

This is a short list of changes that a Machine Learning strategy can bring to a company, as that is why behavioral and change management is extremely critical. And one that top line management level need to influence and encourage in their divisions.


### Is this automation will replace humans in the long term?
It is true that Machine Learning, learning and predicting ability, will cut most of the value-chain where humans are now a days involved to help understand data, process information, understand decisions, crunch customer data, etc. Looking 2 to 3 years ahead in the future it is expected to see high level of machine learning and artificial-intelligence-charged-processes, being managed without human interaction. But..., yes there is a but in this equation...

No matter how intelligent Machine Learning is, only human positions will be able to have the last word on their strategy, work and interact with customers. Just like any sales position in an organization needs Quarterly Reviews, Machine Learning agents and predictions also need to be part of a Quarterly Business Reviews, evaluate them and make corrections.


### Conclusion
Think strategically on Machine-Learning by getting it high on the Business Executives agenda, as enterprises in the next 2 to 3 years will excel based on how high their Machine Learning strategy is positioned.
